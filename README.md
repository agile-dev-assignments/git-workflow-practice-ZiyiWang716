### Why I Chose the Article
I Found this article really interesting becuase the author illustrates the idea of how software developers depend on not just their coding ability, but also, or even more importantly, the big environment and their coworkers to shape their ultimate way of writing code. This idea takes me out of the school-learning style of programming and think more about the different situations that we students might actually encounter when pursuing our career in the future.
